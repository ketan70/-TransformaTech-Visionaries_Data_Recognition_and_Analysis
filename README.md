# DataRISE: Data Recognition and Information Extraction

DataRISE is a project focused on recognizing and extracting information from various sources, including scanned documents, images, and other forms of unstructured data. The project utilizes several tools and technologies, including Python, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using the OpenCV and Tesseract libraries, regular expressions (RegEx), and OpenCV for image processing.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- OCR (cv2 and Tesseract)
- Regular expressions (RegEx)
- OpenCV
- Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib 
- os | Auto HTML
- cv2.getStructuringElement

## Input

The input to DataRISE can come in a variety of forms, including:


- Scanned documents (PDF, JPG, etc.)

- Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
